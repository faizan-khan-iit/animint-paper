** TODOs 

- expand introduction and related work (without mentioning too much
  about what we propose).
- proof-read sections 1-4.2 (I have mostly finished these).
- re-evaluate example Figures. Should we include all of these?
- submit to JCGS.

** Overview

Section 1, Introduction: needs a bigger discussion about the motivation for
interactive/animated/multi-layer/grammared graphics. (without going
into too many details)

Section 2, Related work: does not mention any specifics about
clickSelects/showSelected/animint.

Section 3, clickSelects+showSelected. Introduce the two new aesthetics
via the WorldBank example. Do NOT mention anything about the specific
implementation in the animint R package yet.

Section 4, our implementation in the Animint R package. Now is the
time to finally go into details about how we implemented the compiler
and renderer.

Section 5, comparison study.

Section 6, discussion. Maybe a table with libraries on the rows and
features on the columns.

| library | interactive | layers  | grammar | limitation        |
|---------+-------------+---------+---------+-------------------|
| D3      | many tables | several | no      | low level         |
| dc      | many tables | no      | no      | pre-defined plots |
| cranvas | one table   | yes     | no      | one table         |
| ggplot2 | no          | yes     | yes     | not interactive   |
| ggvis   | shiny       | yes     | yes     | client/server     |
| animint | many tables | yes     | yes     | client/server     |

Section 7, conclusions and future work.
